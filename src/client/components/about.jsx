        <h2> Medication Reminders </h2>
        <p className="blogText">
          The inspiration for this website was to create a device agnostic tool that would remind you 
          to take your medication. After I implemented this however, I quickly realised there wasn't enough
          in this idea to be of use to people. It would also mark the end of this project i've had a lot of fun with.
          Instead, i've expanded medication reminders to be more of a mailing list, and to provide people with the 
          means to brighten their day. From free meditations, curated wholesome memes, and some fresh tunes, I hope
          to create a digital community centered around compassion and love.
